A minimal iOS AR app that displays a wave animation using RealityKit2 Geometry Modifier.

- Xcode 13.3
- Target: iOS / iPadOS 15.0+
- SwiftUI, ARKit, RealityKit 2, Metal

In iOS 15.0+, you can use RealityKit 2 Geometry Modifier to modify vertices of 3d models with Metal code.
This project shows a sample code that displays a wave animation using a Geometry Modifier.
After some seconds, the image texture of the 3d model will be changed.
This is also RealityKit 2's feature. Please check the code.
